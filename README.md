## Data repository

You can access the data using this [Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aRXQXVvw6hz0eYgtJDoixjPQO-_bRKz9). This link contains the mesogeos datacube (`mesogeos_cube.zarr/`), the extracted datasets for the machine learning tracks (`ml_tracks/`), as well as notebooks showing how to access the mesogeos cubes (`notebooks/`).

### Accessing the mesogeos cube

The mesogeos cube is publicly accessible in the following places:

- Google Drive folder: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aRXQXVvw6hz0eYgtJDoixjPQO-_bRK z9
](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aRXQXVvw6hz0eYgtJDoixjPQO-_bRKz9)

#### Option 1: Access from S3 (Best option to download)

```
import zarr
import xarray as xr
import fsspec

url = 'https://my-uc3-bucket.s3.gra.io.cloud.ovh.net/mesogeos.zarr'
ds = xr.open_zarr(fsspec.get_mapper(url))
ds
```

To run this make sure to install `xarray`, `zarr` and `fsspec` libraries. 

**Downloading locally:** You can write the zarr using the [xarray `.to_zarr` method](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/generated/xarray.Dataset.to_zarr.html).

#### Option 2: Access from Google Colab
[notebooks/1_Exploring_Mesogeos.ipynb](notebooks/1_Exploring_Mesogeos.ipynb) shows how to open Mesogeos directly in google colab

## Datacube Generation

Find the code to generate a datacube like mesogeos in [datacube_creation](datacube_creation/).

## Machine Learning Tracks
### Track A: Wildfire Danger Forecasting

This track defines wildfire danger forecasting as a binary classification problem.

More details in [Track A](./ml_tracks/a.fire_danger/)

### Track B: Final Burned Area Prediction

This track is about predicting the final burned area of a wildfire given the ignition point and the conditions of the fire drivers at the first day of the fire in a neighborhood around the ignition point.

More details in [Track B](./ml_tracks/b.final_burned_area/README.md)

## Datacube Details

Mesogeos is meant to be used to develop models for wildfire modeling in the Mediterranean. 
It contains variables related to the ignition and spread of wildfire for the years 2006 to 2022 at a daily 1km x 1km grid.

<details> <summary>Datacube Variables</summary>

The datacube contains the following variables:

- satellite data from MODIS (Land Surface Temperature (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod11a1v061/), Normalized Vegetation Index (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod13a2v061/), Leaf Area Index (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod15a2hv061/))
- weather variables from ERA5-Land (max daily temperature, max daily dewpoint temperature, min daily relative humidity, 
max daily wind speed, max daily surface pressure, mean daily surface solar radiation downwards) (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/10.24381/cds.e2161bac?tab=overview)
- soil moisture index from JRC European Drought Observatory (https://edo.jrc.ec.europa.eu/edov2/home.static.html)
- population count (https://hub.worldpop.org/geodata/listing?id=64) & distance to roads (https://hub.worldpop.org/geodata/listing?id=33) from worldpop.org 
- land cover from Copernicus Climate Change Service (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-land-cover?tab=overview)
- elevation, aspect, slope and curvature from Copernicus EU-DEM (https://land.copernicus.eu/imagery-in-situ/eu-dem/eu-dem-v1.1?tab=download)
- burned areas and ignition points from EFFIS (https://effis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/applications/data-and-services)

## Contributing

We welcome new contributions for new models and new machine learning tracks!

**New Model**: To contribute a new model for an existing track, your code has to be (i) open, (ii) reproducible (we should be able to easily run your code and get the reported results) and (iii) use the same dataset split defined for the track. 
After we verify your results, you get to **add your model and name to the leaderboard**. 
Check the current [leaderboards](https://orion-ai-lab.github.io/mesogeos/).

[Submit a new issue](https://github.com/Orion-AI-Lab/mesogeos/issues/new/choose) containing a link to your code.

**New ML Track**: To contribute a new track, [submit a new issue](https://github.com/Orion-AI-Lab/mesogeos/issues/new/choose).

We recommend at minimum:

1. a dataset extraction process that samples from mesogeos,
2. a description of the task,
3. a baseline model,
4. appropriate metrics.
